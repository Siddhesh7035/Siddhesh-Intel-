Natural Bee Honey is a sweet, viscous substance produced by honey bees through the enzymatic processing of floral nectar. Bees collect nectar from flowers, process it within their hives, and store it in wax honeycombs. Through natural evaporation and regurgitation, the nectar transforms into honey, which serves as the primary food source for bees. The extraction of honey by beekeepers is conducted through processes such as crushing the honeycomb or using honey extractors to separate honey from the comb. Beyond being a natural sweetener, honey is valued for its medicinal and nutritional benefits, making it a significant commodity in global markets.
