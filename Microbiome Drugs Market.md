Microbiome drugs are pharmaceutical products developed using live microorganisms or compounds derived from microorganisms to treat, manage, or prevent diseases. These drugs are designed to restore or modulate the natural microbiota balance in the human body, which plays a crucial role in health and disease. Microbiome drugs fall into three main categories: (1) drugs derived from whole or parts of microorganisms, (2) those derived from microbial primary metabolites, and (3) those derived from microbial secondary metabolites. These therapies are especially promising in fields such as gastrointestinal health, immune modulation, metabolic disorders, and even oncology.

Market Size
In North America, the market was valued at USD 97.25 million in 2023, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 29.66% from 2025 to 2032. This positions North America as a dominant region due to advanced healthcare infrastructure, significant R&D investment, and the presence of key industry players.
