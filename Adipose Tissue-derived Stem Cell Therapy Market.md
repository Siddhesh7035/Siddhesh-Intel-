The global Adipose Tissue-derived Stem Cell Therapy market was valued at US$ 578.9 million in 2024 and is projected to grow to US$ 1.01 billion by 2030, reflecting a CAGR of 9.8% during the forecast period (2024–2030). This substantial growth is attributed to expanding clinical applications, increased research funding, and greater acceptance of regenerative therapies worldwide.

Adipose Tissue-derived Stem Cell Therapy refers to therapeutic treatments utilizing stem cells harvested from adipose (fat) tissue. These stem cells, known as adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), are multipotent, meaning they can differentiate into various cell types, such as adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes. Over recent years, ASCs have become increasingly prominent in regenerative medicine due to their accessibility, abundance, and regenerative capabilities. Common applications include wound healing, orthopedic treatments, and cosmetic therapies, as well as ongoing research in chronic disease management. ASCs are favored for both autologous (patient’s own cells) and allogeneic (donor-derived cells) treatments, driving clinical innovation across various medical fields.
