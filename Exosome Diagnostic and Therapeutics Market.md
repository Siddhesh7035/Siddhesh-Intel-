The global Exosome Diagnostic and Therapeutics Market encompasses the research, development, production, and commercialization of technologies and applications that utilize exosomes for disease diagnosis and treatment. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles secreted by most cell types and play a critical role in cell-to-cell communication. Due to their ability to carry nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids reflective of their originating cells, they are increasingly being used in diagnostics and therapeutics for conditions such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular diseases.

Market Size
In 2022, the global Exosome Diagnostic and Therapeutics market was valued at approximately US$ 101.1 million. It is projected to grow exponentially, reaching US$ 760.6 million by 2029, reflecting a robust Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 33.4% during the forecast period (2023â€“2029). This growth is primarily driven by increased R&D activities, rising awareness of liquid biopsy technologies, and the expanding applications of exosomes in precision medicine. The impact of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war has been taken into consideration in determining these figures.
