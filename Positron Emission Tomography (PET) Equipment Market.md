Positron Emission Tomography (PET) equipment is a critical diagnostic imaging tool used in nuclear medicine to visualize metabolic processes in the body. PET scanners operate by detecting radiation emitted from a radioactive tracer injected into the body. These tracers are typically combined with glucose molecules, enabling the visualization of tissues with higher metabolic activity—particularly useful in detecting cancer, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. PET imaging has evolved with advanced hybrid technologies like PET-CT and PET-MRI, enhancing the precision of diagnostics by combining metabolic and anatomical imaging in a single session.
