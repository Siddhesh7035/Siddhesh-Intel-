Long-Acting Monoclonal Antibodies (LA-mAbs) refer to bioengineered antibodies designed with extended half-lives to provide prolonged therapeutic effects. Unlike conventional antibodies that may require frequent administration, LA-mAbs are optimized for infrequent dosing, enhancing patient compliance and treatment efficacy. These biologics are widely used in the treatment of chronic and complex diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, inflammatory conditions, and infectious diseases.

Market Size
In North America, the market was valued at USD 9.8 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 27.2 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 15.8%, solidifying its dominance due to high healthcare expenditure and early adoption of advanced therapies.
