Thermoplastic powder coatings are an advanced and eco-friendly method of applying a protective and decorative finish to various substrates, including metal and plastic. Unlike traditional liquid coatings, these coatings use a dry powder that melts upon heating to form a durable, uniform finish. These coatings do not require solvents, making them an environmentally friendly alternative with minimal volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. The key components include resins, curing agents, pigments, and performance-enhancing additives.

Market Size
The global thermoplastic powder coatings market was valued at USD 3,834.99 million in 2024 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 5.78% from 2024 to 2030, reaching approximately USD 5,972.76 million by 2030. This growth is fueled by increasing industrial adoption, stringent environmental regulations, and the growing preference for sustainable coating solutions. Key end-use industries such as automotive, construction, and appliances are major contributors to the rising demand for thermoplastic powder coatings.
