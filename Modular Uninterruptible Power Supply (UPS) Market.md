Modular Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) is a type of power protection system that provides backup power in case of power failures. Unlike traditional UPS systems, which are designed as a single unit, Modular UPS systems are composed of multiple, smaller modules that can be stacked together to provide scalable power capacity and runtime. Each module is designed to work independently or in parallel with other modules, providing redundancy and increased reliability. The modular design allows for easy expansion and customization, making it ideal for use in data centers, telecommunications, and industrial applications where high availability and flexibility are required.Report Scope
