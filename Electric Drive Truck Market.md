The global Electric Drive Truck market was valued at US$ 744.2 million in 2023 and is projected to reach US$ 2,382.3 million by 2030, registering a CAGR of 21.5% during the forecast period. This robust growth trajectory highlights the increasing demand for zero-emission commercial transport solutions across both developed and emerging economies.

Electric Drive Truck refers to a category of commercial and heavy-duty vehicles that utilize electric propulsion systems instead of conventional internal combustion engines (ICE). These trucks rely on electric motors powered by onboard battery packs or fuel cells, offering significant advantages in terms of energy efficiency, emissions reduction, and lower operating costs. Common types include light and medium-duty trucks used in urban logistics, as well as heavy-duty trucks for long-haul and industrial applications.
