A CPU socket is a crucial component of a computer motherboard that serves as an interface between the central processing unit (CPU) and the system's electrical circuits. It facilitates communication between the processor and other components, providing power, data transfer capabilities, and cooling support. CPU sockets are uniquely designed to match specific CPU architectures, ensuring compatibility and efficient operation.
