Micronutrients are essential elements that promote plant growth and development, ultimately leading to nutrient-rich food sources for animals and humans. These micronutrients include boron, chlorine, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc, which are frequently in short supply for growing crops. Micronutrients fertilizers help supplement these deficiencies and improve crop yield and quality.
