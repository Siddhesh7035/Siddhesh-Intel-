Sealed Type Microfocus X-Ray Sources are a type of X-ray generation technology used in various applications, such as non-destructive testing, material analysis, and medical imaging. These sources use a sealed tube design, which means that the X-ray tube is sealed off from the environment, eliminating the need for periodic replacement of the anode target. The Microfocus technology used in these sources allows for the production of high-quality, high-resolution images with a small focal spot size. The sealed design also makes these sources more rugged and durable, making them suitable for industrial and scientific applications where reliability and longevity are critical.
